    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">A creative explanation of neural networks using relatable storytelling and generative AI support.</p>

    <section class="mb-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Overview</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">This artifact reimagines neural networks using something universally relatable: pizza. By mapping layers of machine learning architecture to the pizza-making process, this analogy simplifies the complex mechanisms of artificial neural networks. The analogy was crafted for an academic discussion and reflects both pedagogical intent and generative AI collaboration.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">The Pizza Analogy</h2>
      <p class="mb-2"><strong>Option 1 – Signature Pizzas (Pre-Trained Models):</strong> These are your go-to classics — models already trained to perform specific tasks (e.g., image recognition or translation). You trust them like a tried-and-true Margherita.</p>
      <p class="mb-2"><strong>Option 2 – Build Your Own (Custom Neural Networks):</strong> Just like choosing toppings and crust, you tailor the network's architecture and parameters to your specific data and problem.</p>
      <p class="mb-2"><strong>Combo – Transfer Learning:</strong> Start with a classic pizza (pre-trained model), tweak it (fine-tune layers), and make it yours. This is common in modern ML workflows.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Step-by-Step Breakdown</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Input Layer (Ordering Counter):</strong> Where your data starts its journey, just like customizing a pizza order.</li>
        <li><strong>Hidden Layers (Pizza Chefs):</strong> Each chef (layer) transforms the input — kneading dough, adding sauce, toppings, baking — mimicking the weighted computations in neural nets.</li>
        <li><strong>Output Layer (Final Pizza):</strong> The prediction or classification outcome — your hot, delicious pizza.</li>
        <li><strong>Backpropagation (Taste Test & Feedback):</strong> Didn't like the pizza? Adjust the recipe! Just like a neural network adjusts its weights based on error.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="mt-4">This playful analogy not only makes neural networks easier to digest (pun intended), but also sticks in memory — an important quality for any educator or communicator.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">AI Collaboration</h2>
      <p>This artifact was developed using ChatGPT to refine the narrative structure, enhance analogy alignment, and simplify technical descriptions. The AI assisted in tone, flow, and clarity, while all final content decisions and creative framing were mine.</p>
