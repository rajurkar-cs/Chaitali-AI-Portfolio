But here’s the truth: you are already exploring concepts and technologies that many professionals haven’t mastered yet. That’s something to be proud of!
        </p>
        <p class="intro">
            This course isn’t just about completing assignments; it’s about building confidence in your ability to learn, grow, and contribute to the world of AI and machine learning. Your professional portfolio is a way to showcase that growth and potential throughout your entire program at IWU!
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2 class="section-title">You Are on the Cutting Edge</h2>
        <p>The skills and knowledge you’re gaining here are part of a fast-evolving field. While you might not feel like an expert yet, remember that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You’re developing foundational skills that many professionals wish they had.</li>
            <li>You’re engaging with real-world challenges and solutions that matter.</li>
            <li>You’re learning to think critically and creatively—key traits for success in any industry.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2 class="section-title">What Your Portfolio Represents</h2>
        <p>Your portfolio is not just a collection of coursework. It’s a story that highlights:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your curiosity and willingness to tackle new challenges.</li>
            <li>Your ability to learn and apply complex concepts.</li>
            <li>Your potential as a future leader in AI/ML.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each artifact you add will show how you’re building these skills step by step. It’s okay if your work doesn’t feel "perfect" right now. What matters is that it’s authentic and reflects your journey.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">What is a professional portfolio?</h2>
        <p>A professional portfolio is a digital collection of artifacts that showcase your skills, accomplishments, and learning. In this course, your portfolio focuses on providing evidence that reflects your growth and professional competencies as you progress. Over time, your portfolio will become a powerful resource site that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Highlights your expertise and achievements through course-based work.</li>
            <li>Demonstrates your ability to apply AI concepts in real-world scenarios.</li>
            <li>Positions you as a change leader who provides valuable insights, solutions, and resources to others.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This portfolio is not just about showcasing what you have done; it is about demonstrating the value you bring and can continue to bring as a professional. Think of your portfolio as a resource site—a place where your target audience can find examples, ideas, and solutions that you have developed. It should reflect your potential to lead change and make an impact in your field.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="footer-note">
        While this portfolio emphasizes artifacts developed during your coursework, you may also have other professional artifacts from outside this program that showcase your experience. These can be included in a different portfolio or, if added to this one, will not count as any of the required artifacts for this class.
